This file describes my basic to do list for Unangband.
Also see Lib\Todo, which is a dumping group for
various files and ideas.

For a start, here are the current bugs:


- Death and high scores do not record styles and sub-styles.
	Trivial fix. Just haven't got around to it. But it will
break highscore compatibility for people. :(

And new features:
- Implement Ego lights, and monster bleeding/poisoning from
Eyangband.
	This is primarily so that you can cut a monster and watch
it bleed everywhere. Which is currently done as a hack. I was
also thinking about doing magical candles, and haven't decided
whether lanterns will be done in e_info.txt or k_info.txt.

- Implement the player hiding in terrain, and items of
invisibility.
	This will require tweaking the monster AI so that
monsters that cannot see you do something. Acting confused is
in my opinion, a bit of a hack. I'd rather they left the room,
or wandered around the room, if they weren't aware of you. Acting
confused if they are aware of you might be a possibility.

- Implement friendly monsters and uniques.
	Long overdue, but its a reasonably big job.

- Implement magic items the same way as spells.
	The structure is there, but this is guaranteed to
introduce bugs.

- Implement monster spells the same way as player spells.
	Ditto.

- Implement alchemy/manufacturing items.
	This is low priority at this stage.

- Implement room descriptions version 2.
        This will mean that features and objects will be placed
more aesthetically around the room, and match the textual
descriptions.
