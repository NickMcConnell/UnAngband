Unangband now uses an online database to record bugs and feature
requests. See http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=331 for
an up to date list.

The following comprises a rough ideas list not already included

Notes
=====

TODO: Implement the player hiding in terrain, and items of
invisibility.
	This will require tweaking the monster AI so that
monsters that cannot see you do something. Acting confused is
in my opinion, a bit of a hack. I'd rather they left the room,
or wandered around the room, if they weren't aware of you. Acting
confused if they are aware of you might be a possibility.

TODO: Give monsters some AI patterns. eg
Hunt - move to a random room exit, or move down corridor.
Make decision again when encountering another room exit.
Attack anyone from another room. Get the bodies and bring
back to home room.

Patrol - as hunt, but never leave room. Attack anyone from
another room. Return to room if outside it.

Twitch - move randomly (Don't use unless none other possible).

Gather - Use hunt algorithm to go to another room. If room has
items, get items and return to home room and drop them in home
room. Flee anyone from another room if has items, or attack
them otherwise. (requires take item ability).

Scout - move to a random room exit, or move down corridor.
Attack anyone from another room, and set immediately to flee.
Return to home room. (requires ranged attack)

Animals only use patrol and hunt algorithms (Hunting when hungry,
patrol when satiated).

Rest - never leave room. Remains stationary until detects target.
Return to room if outside it.

TODO: Implement friendly monsters and uniques.
	Long overdue, but its a reasonably big job.
Should be less of a job now, as all spells can be cast by monsters
on each other and there are cooperative spells that monsters can
use to assist the player now (such as haste, heal and cure).

TODO:Implement monster spells the same way as player spells.
Don't know if this is necessary, but is a logical conclusion to
much of the 4GAI work already done.

TODO:Implement alchemy/manufacturing items.
	This is low priority at this stage. Perhaps do essences
as per Sangband, or ingredients based system?

TODO:Implement room descriptions version 2.
        This will mean that features and objects will be placed
more aesthetically around the room, and match the textual
descriptions.

TODO:Implement revised bard spell list.
Revise bard spells, so that none are directional spells.
(Eg fiery aura etc.)

TODO:Implement line of sight damage intensification spells.
eg Fire Dance, Wild Waters, Sea's Rage and so on.
These spells affect terrain with the same flavour attack and
result in an extra dynamic action.  Eg Fire Dance causes
all locations in line of sight that cause FIRE damage to burn
again immediately.

TODO:Implement all magic spells so that they are level dependent.

TODO:Implement mana regeneration, searching, detection etc. as a spell effect.

TODO:Implement monster spellbooks, so that monsters can cast all ACID_MAGIC
etc. spells.

TODO: Implement skill system. Unangband skill system comes out of the
specialistaion system: Similar to Sangband, but with restrictions on what
you can spend skills on based on your surroundings. eg you can only learn
weapon & shield skill when you are holding or carrying a shield.
Also add Damage Resistance skill, so that you increase you hps
independently of total skills.

Instead of Oaths, have totals for certain skill combinations limited to
a certain value eg highest magic skill + highest weapon skill may not exceed 150,
Fire Magic + Water Magic may not exceed 150 etc.

Allow spell skills to be learnt based on what spells are known and books
are held. eg to learn any spell in Cantrips requires the player have a
Cantrips book.

Other skills: Literacy (Use of scrolls), Wizardy (Use of staffs), Chemistry
(Use of potions) etc.

TODO:Allow research of spells without a spellbook. You can continue to research
a spell once you have learnt it. This gives you a chance of producing
Research Notes (for spells), Runesticks (For runes), Lyric Sheets (For songs)
or Prayer Beads (for prayers). The item contains a spell from another spell
book that the spell you are researching is contained in. eg researching
Detect Monsters in a magic book of Cantrips may help you produce research
notes for Identify.

TODO: Make mushrooms and other mimic monsters 'hide' in objects that they
mimic.

TODO: Add tents (G:<:R), sails (G:>:R).

TODO: Replace wooden floors with wooden decks.

TODO: Allow player to dig shallow pits, which fill with water etc to become
shallow water.

TODO: Let pits and deep pits fill with water to become deep water etc.

TODO: As previous points, but let water flow into a chasm to become a
waterfall, similiarly lava etc.

The above three should probably use LAVA, ACID etc transitions, rather
than HURT_FIRE, HURT_ACID.

TODO: Should be able to traverse chasms/pits once fallen in without damage
(Actually all MUST_CLIMB terrain).

TODO: Add phases of the moon. During a full moon, light all outside
locations (but not adjacent locations - so still darker than daylight).
During a new moon, treat outside like inside.  Should treat one phase
darker if the night is overcast, and two phases darker if it is
stormy (2 phases darker during daytime treats like a full moon).

TODO: Add before sunrise and after sunset phases of night. During
before sunrise, do not light locations to the west. During
after sunset, do not light locations to the east. These time last
for half an hour.

TODO: Add an eclipse, which lasts 5 minutes and occurs once... light
like a full moon.

TODO: Add monster ability 'reflect/beams' and 'reflect shots/thrown'. These cause either
any bolt/beam attack, or any shot/thrown weapon to reflect in a random compass direction,
instead of affecting the target. This can also reflect back at the player...

TODO: Create set items as per Sangband, but including sets of dragon armor.

Dragon age	Item	Basic ability		3 of set	4 of set	Entire set
------------	------	-------------		-------		--------	----------
Baby dragons	gloves	None.					Act for brand.
Young dragons	boots	None.			Walk on terrain
Mature dragons	shield  Good ac. Resistance.			Temp resistance
Ancient dragons	armour	Resistance, breath. Counts as 2 items of set.
Wyrms		helm	Res blind, breath.					Immunity.

S:set:tval:sval:number required of set:flag(s)
S:set:tval:sval:number required of set:flags

Note that only coloured and metallic dragons get gloves / boots / shield / armour / helm
and have sets.

Metallic dragons also drop their coin type. They only provide immunity, branding, walk
on terrain and temporary resistance to the base element they prefer.
Gem dragons drop gems of their type only.
Drakes drop shields, armour and helms only and do not have sets. However, the shields,
armour and helms are quite useful...

TODO: Assemblies that can be build into objects of any type. Need some way of noting the final
tval / sval / ego / artifact type of the item.

Item		Parts
----		-----
Sword		Handle, blade, guard, pommel
Hafted		Handle, head
Polearm		Handle, head
Light armour	greaves, breast plate, throat guard etc
Heavy armour	greaves, breast plate, throat guard etc
Dragon armour	greaves, breast plate, throat guard etc
Gloves		left glove, right glove
Boots		left boot, right boot
Artifact light	setting, jewel

This in particular allows dragons to always drop parts of dragon armour, that the player
must assemble into the whole item.

TODO: Out of depth objects should come in assemblies, particularly out of depth artifacts.
Then, the player is given a quest by the applicable store owner for the additional parts of
the item. *Important*: Because the player has already 'qualified' for the item by
having the RNG generate it, we should make the quests suitable for the player level, not
the object level. Unless we are feeling evil.

TODO: Player buffs defined in a text file as opposed to code.

TODO: Walk on terrain flags. We horribly hack these and allow the RES_ flags on boots to 
automatically protect against certain terrain types:

Flag		Ability
----		-------
Res_fire	Fire walk	Not harmed by burning oil, fire & smoke
Res_acid	Acid walk	Not harmed by acid or acidic clouds
Res_cold	Ice walk	Not harmed by ice, cannot slip on ice, cannot sink in snow
Res_pois	Swamp walk	Cannot slip on mud, does not sink into mud
Res_elec	Cloud walk	Cannot fall into chasms that are filled with clouds

This is of course, a horrible hack. Note that boots of cloud walking break many of the
puzzles we would otherwise force solutions for by using chasms.

TODO: Extend the idea of clouds to include chasms being affected by HURT_COLD, HURT_WATER,
HURT_ACID and HURT_FIRE to create snow clouds, mist, acidic clouds and smoke respectively.
In order that these can effectively be 'cloud-walked', have them transition as follows
       	      SPREAD                   INSTANT
snow cloud    ----->   thinning cloud  ------>    chasm
       	      HURT_ACID
       	      <--------
			G:>:W
                 	D:The snow cloud begins to thin.

       SPREAD                   INSTANT
mist   ------>   thinning mist  ------>    chasm
       HURT_WATER
       <---------
		 G:>:W
                 D:The mist begins to thin.

       		SPREAD                    INSTANT
acidic cloud    ------>   thinning cloud  ------>    chasm
       		HURT_ACID
       		<--------
			  G:>:G
                 	  D:The acidic cloud begins to thin.

         SPREAD                    INSTANT
smoke    ------>   thinning smoke  ------->    chasm
       	 HURT_FIRE
       	 <--------
		   G:>:S
                   D:The smoke begins to thin.



This gives the player one turn (or more for faster players) in order to move off the
cloud space.

Because chasms are not floors, it is possible to use ball spells and beam spells to
create clouds in the chasms very easily.

In order to create temporary bridges, allow mist to be frozen to create an icy bridge - 
which times out and collapses.

Create cloud levels, which are levels that are 95% unbridged chasms. Have each room
contain either boots of cloud walking or wands of bridge building or web building. Have
each cloud walking room surrounded by a lump of irregular rock that contains a waterfall
of either oil, water, lava or acid, next to the room exit. This forces the player to
experiment with cloud walking in order to move between the room locations.

TODO: Storm clouds should now be created by GF_WIND. GF_WIND should be used to create other
storm effects (e.g. waves), as opposed to the current random hack. GF_WIND should instead
randomly be applied over a level depending on some kind of wind factor - particularly
on surface levels.

TODO: All magically created terrain should create a timer on it, which times out after a
number (50?) of turns and reverts to the old terrain. This should also apply to timed
terrain. Possibly use objects to create these timers.

TODO: Have electrical projections get 'conducted' by acid, water or metal. This means that
instead of using the standard projection code, if an electrical projection hits a grid
that is conductive, it instead randomly moves between adjacent conductive squares until
maximum range is achieved (use MAX_SIGHT as an upper limit). Ball attacks should be
conducted more effectively, so that radius does not decrease damage.

TODO: Have various metal terrains, including metal floors, metal walls (which cannot be
tunnelled or bashed, but are not permanent), and chains. Chains can cross caverns.

TODO: Have the concept of pushing and pulling.

Items which can be pushed:
piles of ice / rubble / wood
chests
wooden platforms
wooden / iron / spiked cages (new terrain)
various traps (get activated when pushed)
sliding walls (new terrain)
weak wooden platforms (turn into pile of wood when pushed)
boulders (new terrain)

You can push terrain to an adjacent terrain provided the adjacent terrain has a SLIDE
flag.

Terrain which has slide flag:
ice / slimy floor
oil-coated floor
slopes (can slide down slope only, however get momentum similar to pulling as below)
shallow / normal / deep pits / chasms (can push terrain into this location, but not out
- it fills the pit up and destroys the terrain)
chain (but not rope or vines)

Items which can be pulled:
rope / chain / vines

If you pull a terrain, it pushes one adjacent terrain with a PUSH flag to its own location,
and then your location the following turn. If that terrain has a PULL flag, it continues
to pull in the direction you are pulling from instead.

Add stone chests, which can be pushed around but not opened. It is only possible to open these
by pushing them into a pit.

You can push monsters into adjacent terrain.

TODO: Have siege engines e.g. ballista, catapults etc which are a fixed location for a weapon
that can be fired.

TODO: Have machines, which are terrain types which when filled with oil and then hurt by
electricity, can create various types of effects. A furnace creates fire. A generator creates
electricity. A pump moves oil/water/acid around. An engine pushes or pulls or opens or 
closes stuff. Two adjacent generators in alternate turns when feed by oil can continuously
run together. 

Machines can be manually operated by opening and closing them, as opposed to having
to hurt them with electricity. However, they require oil.

Create puzzle rooms, using machines. e.g. a pump has to be used to fill a furnace,
because if oil is moved directly next to the furnace, it is set on fire by the furnace and
no longer usable. e.g. an engine has to be run to open a valve to feed oil to a machine.
e.g. an engine has to open an otherwise inaccessible door to let out a monster that the
player has to fight.

TODO: Have crystals of various colours and types, which cause interaction between sound,
electricity and light. A dark crystal absorbs light and creates electricity. A clear crystal
absorbs electricity and creates light. A glowing crystal gives off light and fades. A mirror
reflects light and electricity around. Sound destroys all crystals and mirrors, except tough
coloured crystals. Note that all crystals should let light through. Note that crystals cannot
be tunnelled, and are impassable.

Crystal rooms should start off lit so that the puzzle is fully visible...

To create a basic crystal clearing problem, where the strategy is to minimise the number of
light beams required to clear a path, create a room and fill it with crystals, except for a 1 width
wide path at the bottom. Pick a column of the room and a crystal colour. Then write a sentence
in diagonally down and up that results in each adjecent crystal vibrating from the effect of
the attack of the adjacent crystal. Start with light on the 1st crystal.

Valid sentences are:

rbbbbb...
grbbbbb...

              TIMED
              <------
So a line of red crystals   123123123123  

e.g. regardless of what a red crystal is hit with, every adjacent location is hit by
sound energy at some point, if there are at least 2 adjacent.

e.g. it is safe to hit 2 adjacent green crystals with lite, but hitting 2 adjacent crystals
with sound or electricity causes every adjacent location to be hit with sound energy at some
point.

Hitting the blue crystal in this instance, causes a chain reaction...


TODO: Have light spells use line of sight, as opposed to line of fire, for their
projections.


TODO: It should now be possible to create trapped areas as follows (where < is falling
terrain and % is a vent):

####.      #####.
#<%%.   or #<%%%.
####.      #####.

This results in the the floor locations getting hit, on the left, every 3 turns,
or on the right every 4 turns (an adjacent water fall will hit every 2 turns).

TODO: Additional store functions. If a store is sold an empty wand / staff, it charges it.
If a store is sold the constituents for an object it attempts to make it.


TODO: Stores, in conjunction with the character's charisma, offer additional quests based
on what the player stat is. In particular:
* if the player is diseased (and not just lightly) have the temple offer a quest to cure the
particular disease.
* same for drained stats.
* if the player has part of an assembly, the store owner gives a quest for the next part
* the armoury gives quests to kill additional dragons, once a first dragon of a particular
type is killed, to collect the skin in order to make the appropriate dragon object
* all stores give quests if they are sold an object they are not aware of, to find an
additional x objects to 'analyse how it is made'
* once this quest is complete, a store offers a quest to restock the same, by killing x
monsters of a particular type and collecting a body part of some kind

TODO: Drop chunks of metals and large jewels for manufacturing purposes.

TODO: Stores should preferentially stock items that the player actually buys.

TODO: Players pick their own stats when they advance a level.

TODO: Mystics carry essences.

TODO: Have an option birth_evil that automatically flags the player as evil. This means
they do not have to worry about which weapon combinations to wield as much. Also, evil players
will never get allies.

TODO: Have uniques corresponding to the players family. They are primarily quest 
givers, however, if the player is evil, they will spit, insult, and wail at
the player. (Considering vomit on, but it might be a bit much).

TODO: Higher level birds, for bird summoners.

TODO: 'Good' monsters don't summon evil. 'Evil' monsters don't summon good.

TODO: I like the idea of being able to get onto the roof of a building. In which case, the line of
sight algorithm needs to be special cased, so that all 'roof' grids block line of sight in
the traditional sense, and the player only has line of sight and line of fire to monsters with
MFLAG_OVER set.


e.g. ......,,,
     .#####,,,
     .##b##,,,
     .#a##@,,,
     .#####,,,
     ......,,,

The player gets LOS calculated to the grids marked with a , normally. However,
all the roof grids block LOS in the traditional sense (otherwise the player would
see the floors underneath the roof). The player can't see or project to the 'a' ant, because
the ant does not have the MFLAG_OVER set. e.g. the ant is on
the real floor underneath the roof.

However the player can see and the 'b' bat, because the bat has the MFLAG_OVER set (e.g. is
flying over the building). Furthermore, if the player throws a fireball at the bat, the ant
won't be affected. This requires setting some kind of PROJECT_OVER flag set when projecting
at a target when you are climbing or MFLAG_OVER, and the first step is covered...

TODO: Elemental effects that cause more than 100 hp damage (before resistance) “The air around you
is superheated/frozen.” “There is a static feeling in the air.” “Water swirls about you.” “Acid
swirls about you.” These mean that when you attempt to use  an item vulnerable to the effect
e.g. potion it is destroyed (Or for electricity, discharged), unless the item ignores the effect.
This occurs even if you are immune. This can also be associated with room types, or
when you activate an item / cast a spell that does more than this in damage. Wind causes windy
effect preventing missiles/throwing.

TODO: High level bird from Zangband.

The Shantak (L.Dark 'B')
=== Num:434 Lev:27 Rar:2 Spd:+10 Hp:25d20 Ac:55 Exp:280
A scaly bird larger than an elephants, with a horse-like head. It is normally found on dungeon level 27, and moves quickly. A kill of this sanity-blasting natural evil creature is worth about 2520.00 points for a 1st level character. It is magical, casting spells which terrify or haste-self; 1 time in 6. It is suitable for riding. It resists acid. it won't evolve. It is fairly observant of intruders, which it may notice from 120 feet. It can bite to attack with damage 1d6, bite to attack with damage 1d6, and bite to attack with damage 1d6. (Hengband 1.6.0)

TODO: Allow monsters to ride other monsters.

We display this by 'shimmering' both the ATTR and CHAR of both the riding and ridden monster.
The ridden monster moves for both monsters. The riding monster can choose to jump off,
or make ranged or melee attacks. Mature dragons (but not ancient or wyrms), drakes, horses,
large wolves, bears, large birds etc. can be ridden. Majority of attacks are aginst the ridden
monster, as opposed to the riding but PROJECT_BOOM affects all monsters in the stack.

The ridden monster sits at the top of the stack...

Should allow player to ride friendly or unfriendly monsters. Similarly, player may choose to
jump off at any time, or 'order' the monster around. May have easy_rider option to allow 
movement keys to order the monster around. We deliberately make ridden monsters hard to
control by the player, and not correspond to the player speed.

TODO: Allow small monsters to stack on each other.


TODO: Have a primative economy.

Store purse size increases by the profit they make from sales, and reduces by the cost they make
from purchases. Cycling stock out earns the store 50% of the stock value; new stock in costs the
store 50% (maybe 40% - test) of the stock value. The stock costs and profits on the blackmarket
are likely to be different... services of course, never cost the store anything.

Prices inflate based on the total purse size of the town / divided by the default purse size of
each store.

e.g. if the player has bought lots of stuff, prices go up. If they sell lots of stuff, prices go
down. However costs don't go down as fast as prices, if at all.

A store can go bankrupt if they run out of money, and are unable to sell their stock. To make this
more likely, a store with a small purse size is more likely to put stuff on sale to try to make a
profit. Note that the costs of purchasing this stock do not get discounted so they are likely to
continue to lose money this way. When a store bankrupts, the inflation in the economy is affected
implicitly, because there is a smaller total purse size in the town.

A new shopkeeper will come in after a short while after a store is bankrupted. The new shop has a
chance of being in competition with an existing shop, as opposed to being the same type of store
as previously.

A store keeps track of player purchases and sales. A sale decreases the frequency of a store
restocking an item. A purchase increases the frequency. High frequencies have the following impact:
 *  the store is more likely to stock multiples of the item
 *  the store increases the price of the item (special orders, increased demand)
 *  very high frequencies cause multiple shops to stock an item. The threshold is likely to be
initial shop, then general store, then black market (the black market always charges a premium).
 *  when this happens, overall prices drop again (production has increased)

Low frequencies have the following impact:
 *  the item is more likely to be discounted
 *  the shopkeeper may stop stocking the item
 *  the shopkeeper may refuse to purchase the item

If multiple stores in a town stock the same item, the player gets an advantage whilst haggling
and the shopkeeper is likely to arrive at the final price sooner and this price will be closer
to the cost. If only one store stocks the item, the reverse happens (this is the Angband default -
be sure to balance it correctly).

Each town has a separate currency, that the player must conver their money to in order to buy
anything. The player collects money in which ever currency they last had. The conversion rate
is affected by the inflation of the old and new towns, with an overhead tax, depending on how
usurous the money changer is.

The player can donate to certain stores (the temple, the magic shop - for research), and tip others.
Some shopkeepers are are too proud to accept. Potentially though e.g. the general store may have
a Village Idiot fund etc.


TODO: Add a materials system.

TV_MATERIAL

SV_MATERIAL_WOOD – a bundle of #; staffs

SV_MATERIAL_METAL – a chunk of #; wands

SV_MATERIAL_STONE – a large #; rings

Some items are generated with {empty socket}. This can have an SV_MATERIAL_STONE applied
to it. The resulting item also gets the abilities of the ring applied to it that is
associated with the stone.

Mushrooms can be applied to 1 sword / polearm or up to 5 arrows/bolts. Potions can be
applied to 1 sword/polearm or up to 20 arrows/bolts. These apply the mushroom or potion
blow effects when swung / fired.

Ego-items. Each ego item is associated with a wand sval. The ego item is ‘flavoured’ with
the flavour of the wand. (e.g. Red Armour of Elvenkind).

Item forging: this is a way of turning junk, bodies or materials into useful items. Forging
needs a source of fire.

You ‘add items’ to a forging session, and it comes up with a list of possible outcomes, from
which you pick one item.

Bodies and body parts can be turned into rations, potions, ink, skeletons or parts of bodies;
skeletons into multiple bones.

Skulls can be turned into empty bottles or potions (with body parts or other potions).

Bones can be turned into batons, clubs or arrows.

Branches can be turned into staffs, torches, bundles of wood, clubs, batons, arrows.

Skin can be turned into scrolls (with feathers and ink), empty flasks, hafted weapons (with
metal), soft armour, leather, cloaks.

Wood can be turned into staffs, pole arms (with metal), arrows.

Metal can be turned into wands, swords, hard armour and used to create higher level soft
armour, ego-items, bolts, shot (but not pebbles).

Stones can assist the creation of other items.

Potions can be turned into other potions, ink.

Extra powers can be based on the flavour and/or flags of associated with the objects
creating an item (staff power for wood, wand power for metal, ring power for stone).

Rods, amulets can be forged from a variety of materials, depending on flavour.

TV_ESSENCE, SV_ESSENCE_attack effect (e.g. GF_ ).

Essences can be used to add flags to item.
