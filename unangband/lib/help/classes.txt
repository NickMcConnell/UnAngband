=== Classes ===
 
 
          Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  Some
          classes  are not recommended for certain races, for instance, a
          Half-Troll should not become a Paladin.  For the first few games 
          it  is  suggested that you run a warrior or rogue.  Spell casting
          generally requires a more experienced  player  that  is  familiar
          with survival techniques.
 
***** <Warrior>
          Warrior
               A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  of
               his  problems  by cutting them to pieces, but will occasion-
               ally fall back  on the help of a magical device.  His  prime
               stats  are  Strength  and Constitution, and a good Dexterity
               can really help at times.  A Warrior will be good at  Fight-
               ing and Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills.

***** <Mage> 
          Mage
               A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack
               his  way  through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his
               magic to defeat,  deceive, confuse, and escape.  A  mage  is
               not really complete without an assortment of magical devices
               to use in addition to his spells.  He can master the  higher
               level  magical  devices far easier than anyone else, and has
               the best saving throw to resist effects of  spells  cast  at
               him.  Intelligence  and   Dexterity  are  his primary stats.
               There is no rule that says  a  mage  cannot  become  a  good
               fighter, but spells are his true realm.
 
 ***** <Priest>
         Priest
               A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore  the
               dungeon  only  to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if
               treasure just happens to fall into  their  packs,  well,  so
               much  more  to  the  glory of their church!  Priests receive
               their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose which
               spells they will learn.  They are familiar with magical dev-
               ices, preferring to call them instruments of  god,  but  are
               not  as good as a mage in their use.  Priests have good sav-
               ing throws,  and  make  decent  fighters. They are limited
               in their ability to use blood-letting weapons, and are
               penalized when wielding weapons that are not specifically
               sanctioned (blessed) by their god. Wisdom and Charisma are
               the priest's primary stats.
 
 ***** <Rogue>
         Rogue
               A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his  cunning,
               but  is capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He
               is the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible
               for  him  to  overcome.  A rogue has a high stealth allowing
               him to sneak around many creatures without having to  fight,
               or sneak up and get the first blow.  A rogue's perception is
               higher than any other class, and many times he will notice a
               trap  or  secret  door  before having to search.  A rogue is
               superior to all other  classes than mages  for their magical
               item skills and should rely on them heavily. Rogues can also
               learn a few spells, but not the  powerful  offensive  spells
               magi  can use.  A rogue's primary stats are Intelligence and
               Dexterity.
 
 ***** <Ranger>
         Ranger
               A Ranger is a warrior/mage.  He is a good fighter,  and  the
               best  of  the  classes  with a missile weapon such as a bow.
               The ranger learns spells much more slowly than a  mage,  but
               is  capable  of  learning all  but the most powerful spells.
               Because a ranger is really  a  dual  class  character,  more
               experience  is  required for him to advance.  A ranger has a
               good stealth, good perception, good searching, a good saving
               throw,  and is good with magical devices.  His primary stats
               are Intelligence and Dexterity.
 
***** <Paladin> 
          Paladin
               A Paladin is a warrior/priest.  He is a very  good  fighter,
               second  only to the warrior class, but not very good at mis-
               sile weapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace then the
               priest,  but  can even  receive the most  powerful  prayers.
               Because a paladin is  really  a  dual  class  character,  it
               requires  more  experience  to advance him.  A paladin lacks
               much in the way of abilities.  He is poor at  stealth,  per-
               ception,  searching,  and  magical devices.  He has a decent
               saving throw due to his divine alliance.  His primary  stats
               are Strength and Charisma.
 
***** <Thief>
          Thief
               A thief is the non-magic using counter-part to the rogue.
               The thief has the highest stealth of any class, and is the
               only class to have their stealth improve over the levels.
               He is as good a fighter as a rogue, but does not have the
               magical item skills or spells that a rogue may use to get
               out of tight spots. Instead, he must rely on his cunning
               and skill, avoiding tougher monsters and hoping to steal
               the treasure from under their noses. Dexterity is the prime
               attribute for thieves, followed by a good Strength.

***** <Archer>
          Archer
               The archer is to missile weapons, what the warrior is to
               melee. The archer has the highest missile weapon skills of
               any class, and must rely in this skill to scoot and shoot
               to engage enemies, as their melee skills are inadequate
               for hand to hand fighting. Because the archer does not have
               magical abilities, they do not require much experience to
               advance in levels. Dexterity is a key requirement for archers
               and they need a good strength to use the more powerful
               hitting of the missile weapons.

***** <Shaman>
          Shaman
               The shaman is a multi-class Priest/Mage, capable of casting
               from both prayer and magic books. Because of their highly
               magical bent, they do not tend to have as many skills as
               either the priest or mage class, and do not tend to get spells
               from either class as quickly, except for elemental attack
               and creature summoning type spells, which they are the equal
               or superior of the other magic-users. Shamans require a high
               Dexterity, Dexterity being their prime requisite for
               determining mana and spell failure.  Unlike Priests, Shamans do
               not have restrictions against spilling blood, but are
               penalized for wearing gloves on all spells, like Mages and
               other magic using classes.

***** <Bard>
          Bard
               The Bard is a special spellcaster, who uses songs and musical
               instruments to cast magical spells. The Bard keeps their
               spells in song books, but are capable of reading both Magic
               and Prayer books, but may not find all spells (Even similar
               to their songs) legible in these books. Similarly, Mages,
               Priests and other spell casting classes may be able to read
               and cast some spells from Bardic song books. Bards are unique
               in that many of their songs can be continued from round to
               round while they perform other activities, and they can wield
               a musical instrument to improve the power of these songs.
               Bards primary attribute is Charisma, which determines their
               mana and spell failure. They are only average to middling
               fighters and archers, but their magic may help in a number
               of sticky situations.
