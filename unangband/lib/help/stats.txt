=== Stats ===

          Strength
               Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee
               combat.  A high strength can improve your chances of hitting
               as well as the amount of damage done with each hit.  Char-
               acters with low strengths may receive penalties.  Strength
               is also useful in tunnelling and in carrying heavy items.
 
          Intelligence
               Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like
               spellcasters, mages, rangers, and rogues.  Intelligence
               will affect the number of spells you may learn each level as
               well as the number of spell points you receive.  A high
               intelligence may also improve your chances of successfully
               casting a spell.  You cannot learn spells if your intelligence
               is 7 or lower.  A good intelligence can also help with using
               magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.
 
          Wisdom
               The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability
               of a priest or paladin to use prayers, just like intelligence
               affects spellcasting.  Again, high wisdom will increase the
               number of spell points you have and increase the number of
               prayers you can learn each level, while improving the chance
               that a prayer will be successful.  A good wisdom can also
               help to improve your chances of resisting magical spells cast
               upon you by monsters.
 
          Dexterity
               Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high
               dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with
               lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and
               will increase his chances of hitting with any weapon and
               dodging blows from enemies.  Dexterity is also useful in
               picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from
               some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons. Indeed, if 
               the character has a high enough dexterity, thieves will
               never be successful in stealing from the player.
 
          Constitution
               Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
               body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
               character with a high constitution will receive more hit
               points and also recover them faster while resting.
 
          Charisma
               Charisma represents a character's personality and physical
               appearance.  A character with a high charisma will receive
               better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a
               very low charisma may be robbed blind. 
 

=== Abilities ===

          Characters possess some different abilities which can help them
          to survive.  The starting abilities of a character are based upon
          race and class.  Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats,
          and may increase with the level of the character.

          Infra-vision
               Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources. Since  most
               of the dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow
               the player to see walls and objects.  Infra-vision will allow
               a  character  to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a cer-
               tain distance.  This ability works equally well with or with
               out a light source.  However, many of Angband's creatures are
               cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a
               light source. All non human races have innate infra-vision
               ability.  Humans (including Dunedain) cannot gain infra-vision 
               unless it is magically enhanced. Infravision does not increase
               with character level, and is purely dependent on race and on 
               magical equipment.
 
          Fighting
               Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
               fists.  Normally a character gets a single blow from any
               weapon, but if his dexterity and strength are high enough,
               he may receive more blows per round with lighter weapons.
               Strength and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an
               opponent.  This skill increases with the level of the char-
               acter.
 
          Shooting Ability
               Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is
               included in this skill.  Different stats apply to different
               weapons, but this ability may modify the distance an object
               is thrown/fired, the amount of damage done, and the ability
               to hit a creature.  This skill increases with the level of
               the character.
 
          Saving Throws
               A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the
               effects of a spell cast on him by another person/creature.
               This does not include spells cast on the player by his own
               stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty potion.  This ability
               increases with the level of the character, but then most
               high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it
               tends to even out.  A high wisdom also increases this abil-
               ity.
 
          Stealth
               The ability to move silently about is very useful.  Charac-
               ters with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents,
               gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to notice
               a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid
               certain fights.  This skill is based entirely upon race and
               class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
 
          Disarming
               Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also
               includes picking locks on traps and doors.  A successful
               disarming will gain the character some experience.  A trap
               must be found before it can be disarmed.  Dexterity and
               intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and this
               ability increases with the level of the character.
 
          Magical Devices
               Using a magical device such as a wand or staff  requires
               experience and knowledge.  Spell users such as mages and
               priests are therefore much better at using a magical device
               than say a warrior.  This skill is modified by intelligence,
               and increases with the level of the character.

          Searching Frequency (Perception)
               Perception is the ability to notice something without
               actively seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon
               race and class, and will never improve unless magically
               enhanced.

          Searching Ability (Searching)
               To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
               and traps on chests.  Rogues are the best at searching, but
               mages, rangers, and priests are also good at it.  This skill
               is based entirely upon race and class, and will never
               improve unless magically enhanced.

=== Stat Bonus Tables ===

Stat, hit dice, infravision and experience points per level modifications 
due to race are listed in the following table.  To get the total hit dice 
and XP modifier, add the "race" and "class" numbers: for instance, a 
Dwarf Priest has a hit die of 11+2=13 (i.e. he will get 1d13 hit points per 
level, adjusted for constitution) and an XP modifier of 20+20=40%.

For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the base 
level of the ability, while the second figure (in parentheses) is the bonus
that the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, to find out the
total skill value of any character's skills, add the "race" value to the
"class" value, and then the bonus once for every ten levels that the character
has.  

(Please note, however, that these numbers are only good for comparing 
characters to each other in the absence of other bonuses from high stats 
(strength bonus to-dam, dex bonus to-hit, wisdom bonus to saving throw,
intelligence bonus to magical device usage, etc.) or wearing magical items.)
