=== Races ===

There are eleven different races that you can choose from in Angband.  Some
races are restricted as to what profession they may be, and each race has
its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. Most races also
have intrinsic abilities.
 
***** <Human>
         Human
               The human is the base character.  All other races are com-
               pared to them.  Humans can choose any class and are average
               at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any
               other race because of their shorter life spans.  No racial
               adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human.
 
***** <Half-Elf>
         Half-Elf
               Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human,  but
               not as wise or strong.  Half-elves are slightly better at magic,
               disarming, saving throws, stealth, bows and searching, but they
               are not as good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any
               class and have their dexterity sustained.
 
***** <Elf>
         Elf
               Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
               fighting.  They tend to be smarter and faster than either
               humans or half-elves, but their wisdom and strength are low.  
               Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth,
               bows and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.  
               Elves are creatures more of magic than religion, and may thus 
               not be priests or paladins: and they are resistant to attacks 
               involving bright light, and have their dexterity sustained.
 
***** <Hobbit>
         Hobbits
               Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing,  and
               have good saving throws.  They also are very good at search-
               ing, disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excel-
               lent rogues, but prefer to be called burglars.  They will be
               much weaker than humans, and not good at melee fighting.
               Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm
               creatures at a distance.  Hobbits may be warriors, rogues or
               rangers.  They have a strong hold on their life force, and  
               are thus intrinsically resistant to life draining.
 
***** <Gnome>
         Gnome
               Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings.
               They, like  the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like
               homes.  Gnomes make excellent mages, and have very good saving
               throws.  They are good at searching, disarming, perception,
               and stealth.  They have lower strength than humans so they
               are not very good at fighting with hand weapons.  Gnomes have
               fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures
               at a distance.  A gnome may choose between being a warrior,
               mage, priest, or rogue.  Gnomes are intrinsically protected
               against paralysis and some slowing effects.
 
***** <Dwarf>
         Dwarf
               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
               Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are
               excellent choices for a warrior or priest - or indeed, that
               combination of the two, the paladin.  Dwarves tend to be
               stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than
               humans.  Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise,
               they resist spells which are cast on them.  Dwarves also have
               very good infra-vision because they live underground.  They
               do have one big drawback, though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and
               proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no
               good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In
               other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.  They can never
               be blinded. 
 
***** <Half-Orc>
         Half-Orc
               Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but
               are terrible at magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
               and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.
               Half-Orcs are, let's face it, ugly.  They tend to pay more for
               goods in town.  Half-Orcs do make good warriors and rogues,
               for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great
               constitutions and lots of hit points.  Because of their
               preference to living underground to on the surface, half-orcs
               resist darkness attacks.
 
***** <Half-Troll>
         Half-Troll
               Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points
               than any other character race.  They are also very stupid and
               slow.  They will make great warriors and iffy priests.  They
               are bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.
               They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.
               They also happen to be fun to run...  Half-trolls always have
               their strength sustained, and they regenerate like other trolls.
               Unfortunately, this regeneration also requires them to eat more 
               food than other races.
 
***** <Dunadan>
         Dunadan
               Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder
               race surpasses human abilities in every field, especially
               constitution.  However, being men of the world, very little is
               new to them, and levels are very hard to gain...  They can
               play all classes except the rogue, as Dunedain are too noble to 
               stoop to petty crime (when a Dunadan goes evil, he does it in 
               a much bigger way.)  Their constitution cannot be reduced.
 
***** <High-Elf>
         High-Elf
               High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard 
               and answered the call from the Valar at the very beginning of 
               time, before the sun and moon were made, and lived in the 
               Blessed Realm for many thousands of years before returning to 
               mortal lands. Because of this, they are far superior in terms 
               of abilities when compared to their lesser Elven kindred, and 
               are able to be priests as well as all the other classes that 
               normal Elves can be. They can also see into the invisible
               world of ghosts and wraiths. However, they find new experience
               even harder to come by than Dunedain: and their wisdom is 
               still a little suspect. And like normal Elves, they resist
               attacks involving bright light.  High Elves cannot be rogues
               (for the same reasons as Dunedain cannot be rogues) or paladins,
               but may be all other classes.

***** <Kobold>
         Kobold
               Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell 
               underground.  They can see in the dark better than almost 
               any other race, and are intrinsically resistant to poisons 
               of all kinds.  They have a good dexterity and constitution. 
               However, they are weaker than humans, and also not noted for
               great intelligence.  Furthermore, they are ugly, and not 
               trusted in town.  And while their constitution makes them 
               tough, it still cannot prevent the fact that they are not the 
               biggest of creatures, and have few hit points.  They can be 
               warriors, rangers, rogues or priests.
