=== Styles ===

        Each classes may choose to specialise in a particular style for a
        10% additional experience penalty. Some classes, notably Rangers
        and Priests are less powerful that the Vanilla Angband characters
        but may choose to regain their former abilities through particular
        choices of styles. To compensate, non-specialised Rangers and Priests
        have less of an experience penalty than their Vanilla counterparts.

        The styles confer a number of different benefits as explained below.
        More importantly, each class style suggests a particular sub-class
        type listed in brackets, that can be used to further distinguish
        different characters. The styles effectively expand the number of
        player classes from 9 to over 100.

                and higher powers grant them a lessening of the restriction
                on blood-letting, to symbolically allow them to use blunt
                weapons. Though a mace may smash open a skull as effectively
