=== Welcome to Unangband ===

I want to welcome you with open arms to Unangband, a variant of Angband which
I have spent some not inconsiderable time and effort developing over more
than 10 years.

Unangband attempts to create a place of mystery, that you will grow to know
and understand, while still leaving you surprised and intrigued at every
unexpected turn.  You will fail in your quest to kill Morgoth many times, but
I hope every failure is at least interesting and different from the last,
and provides a sense of enlightenment about the underlying mechanics of the
game. To quote another game developer 'Failure is fun!' and it is this sense
of slow, but fruitful accomplishment that I hope this game provides you.

And should you finish in your quest, and hold Melkor's iron crown in your
grip, you should realise that this game is infinitely replayable, but also
that I have never come close to the victory you now feel.

Good luck! And good hunting.
                                                     - Andrew Doull
