=== New Options ===

Unangband attempts to implement most of its new features as options or
info.txt file modifications (see the lib\edit\ directory). Switch the
Variant and Save-file options on to play the full Unangband experience,
or switch off those new features you dislike.

There are also a number of options under other menus that can be used
to modify various new features in the game.

=== New User Interface options ===

***** <stack_force_pvals>
Merge pvals when stacking    [stack_force_pvals]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, if they have pvals of the
    same sign. The pval is the object charges for wands or staffs, turns of
    light remaining for torches, or its stat or skill modifier for rings
    and amulets. The resulting stack averages the pvals, and rounds up, but
    keeps an internal record of how many objects have the next lowest pval.
    You can force this behaviour by inscribing both objects with {=s} even
    without this option set.
    This object is the least 'realistic' of all the stacking options. It
    requires that the Save-file option variant_pval_stacks is set.

***** <stack_force_times>
Merge timeouts when stacking    [stack_force_times]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, if they are timed out or
    still have a time out running. This allows (charging) and charged
    objects such as rods and dragon armour to stack completely. The
    resulting stack has the largest timeout of any item in the stack. You
    can force this behaviour by inscribing both objects with {=s} even
    without this option set.
    This option requires that the Save-file option variant_time_stacks is
    set.

***** <easy_autos>
Automatically inscribe all objects
    Whenever you inscribe or uninscribe an object, all objects of the same
    kind will be inscribed or uninscribed, including objects that are
    subsequently created. To edit this, use the ~ command and display the
    objects or ego items you wish to modify. You can then modify the auto-
    inscriptions, and save them to a preference file.

***** <easy_search>
Start searching if not disturbed
    After 20 turns without being disturbed, the character will auto-
    matically enter Search mode. This is most useful for characters
    using the new variant_fast_moves option, as this allows them to
    recover from being tired without additional keypresses.


=== Disturbance options ===

***** <verify_mana>
Verify critical mana
    The game will always prompt you to confirm casting a spell if it
    would leave you with less mana, than the Hitpoint warning
    percentage.


=== Game-play options ===

***** <view_unsafe_grids>
Map marked by detect traps    [view_unsafe_grids]
     Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a detect
     trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This allows you to
     determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect traps, but does not
     ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x' are trap free. This option
     has no effect on surface grids, but outdoor locations cannot be trapped.

***** <reseed_artifacts>
Reseed random artifacts on death    [reseed_artifacts]
     The seed for random artifacts will be re-rolled at character death.
     Without this option, artifacts in the same save file should remain from
     game to game, provided neither the monster.txt or artifact.txt info
     files are modified. Artifact memory will also persist if the artifacts
     are not reseeded.


=== Efficiency options ===

***** <room_names>
Display room names
     When entering a lit room, the name of the room will be displayed as
     a brief message. Room names can indicate what types of creatures,
     treasures or traps can be encountered in that room if the
     variant_room_info option is switched on.

***** <room_descriptions>
     When entering a room, a description of the contents of the room will
     be displayed. If the room is lit, visible features will be noted, other-
     wise only sounds, wind and temperature will be noticed. The description
     will not be displayed again, once the room is lit, except by looking
     at yourself while in the room, or at the contents of the room while
     outside it. The room description will provide important information
     about what types of creatures, treasure, traps or magical effects are
     in the room if the variant_room_info option is switched on.



=== Display options ===

***** <show_flavors>
Show flavors in object descriptions    [view_flavors]
    Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object graphics, even for
    objects whose type is known.

***** <view_glowing_lite>
Use special colors for glowing lite (slow)   [view_glowing_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "glowing" grids in
    certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    Glowing grids are grids adjacent to permanently glowing features such
    as torches, magical lights and lava.
    Turning this option off will improve game speed as the code is somewhat
    less efficient than the other special color options.

***** <view_surface_lite>
Use special colors for surface lite (slow)   [view_surface_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "surface" grids in
    certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    This will cause locations on the surface that are lit by sunlight but
    not outside to appear darker.
    Turning this option off may improve game speed.


=== Birth options ===

***** <birth_rand_artifacts>
Randomize all of the artifacts    [birth_rand_artifacts]
     A different set of artifacts will be created, in place of the standard 
     ones. This is intended primarily for people who have played enough to
     know what most of the standard artifacts do and have got bored with
     them. Without this option set, the standard artifacts will be used,
     along with a selection of random artifacts.

***** <birth_campaign>
Birth: Play in Lord of the Rings campaign    [birth_campaign]
     The character will start in Hobbiton, instead of Angband, and be able
     to travel to Rivendell, the Lonely Mountain, Isengard and other
     locations featured in the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings books.
     Be prepared for out of depth uniques (Especially at night), dungeon
     guardians you have to defeat in order to progress further, quest
     rewards in set locations, and dangerous battlefields and towers.

=== Cheating options ===

***** <cheat_auto>
Cheat: Auto-inscribe items as if known    [cheat_auto]
    Cheaters never win. But they squeltch lots.
