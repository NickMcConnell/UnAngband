=== New Options ===

Unangband attempts to implement most of its new features as options or
info.txt file modifications (see the lib\edit\ directory). Switch the
Variant and Save-file options on to play the full Unangband experience,
or switch off those new features you dislike.

There are also a number of options under other menus that can be used
to modify various new features in the game.

=== New User Interface options ===

***** <stack_force_pvals>
Merge pvals when stacking    [stack_force_pvals]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, if they have pvals of the
    same sign. The pval is the object charges for wands or staffs, turns of
    light remaining for torches, or its stat or skill modifier for rings
    and amulets. The resulting stack averages the pvals, and rounds up, but
    keeps an internal record of how many objects have the next lowest pval.
    You can force this behaviour by inscribing both objects with {=s} even
    without this option set.
    This object is the least 'realistic' of all the stacking options. It
    requires that the Save-file option variant_pval_stacks is set.

***** <stack_force_times>
Merge timeouts when stacking    [stack_force_times]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, if they are timed out or
    still have a time out running. This allows (charging) and charged
    objects such as rods and dragon armour to stack completely. The
    resulting stack has the largest timeout of any item in the stack. You
    can force this behaviour by inscribing both objects with {=s} even
    without this option set.
    This option requires that the Save-file option variant_time_stacks is
    set.

***** <easy_autos>
Automatically inscribe all objects
    Whenever you inscribe or uninscribe an object, all objects of the same
    kind will be inscribed or uninscribed, including objects that are
    subsequently created. To edit this, use the ~ command and display the
    objects or ego items you wish to modify. You can then modify the auto-
    inscriptions, and save them to a preference file.

***** <easy_search>
Start searching if not disturbed
    After 20 turns without being disturbed, the character will auto-
    matically enter Search mode. This is most useful for characters
    using the new variant_fast_moves option, as this allows them to
    recover from being tired without additional keypresses.


=== Disturbance options ===

***** <verify_mana>
Verify critical mana
    The game will always prompt you to confirm casting a spell if it
    would leave you with less mana, than the Hitpoint warning
    percentage.


=== Game-play options ===

***** <view_unsafe_grids>
Map marked by detect traps    [view_unsafe_grids]
     Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a detect
     trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This allows you to
     determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect traps, but does not
     ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x' are trap free. This option
     has no effect on surface grids, but outdoor locations cannot be trapped.

***** <reseed_artifacts>
Reseed random artifacts on death    [reseed_artifacts]
     The seed for random artifacts will be re-rolled at character death.
     Without this option, artifacts in the same save file should remain from
     game to game, provided neither the monster.txt or artifact.txt info
     files are modified. Artifact memory will also persist if the artifacts
     are not reseeded.


=== Efficiency options ===

***** <room_names>
Display room names
     When entering a lit room, the name of the room will be displayed as
     a brief message. Room names can indicate what types of creatures,
     treasures or traps can be encountered in that room if the
     variant_room_info option is switched on.

***** <room_descriptions>
     When entering a room, a description of the contents of the room will
     be displayed. If the room is lit, visible features will be noted, other-
     wise only sounds, wind and temperature will be noticed. The description
     will not be displayed again, once the room is lit, except by looking
     at yourself while in the room, or at the contents of the room while
     outside it. The room description will provide important information
     about what types of creatures, treasure, traps or magical effects are
     in the room if the variant_room_info option is switched on.



=== Display options ===

***** <view_glowing_lite>
Use special colors for glowing lite (slow)   [view_glowing_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "glowing" grids in
    certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    Glowing grids are grids adjacent to permanently glowing features such
    as torches, magical lights and lava.
    Turning this option off will improve game speed as the code is somewhat
    less efficient than the other special color options.

***** <view_surface_lite>
Use special colors for surface lite (slow)   [view_surface_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "surface" grids in
    certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    This will cause locations on the surface that are lit by sunlight but
    not outside to appear darker.
    Turning this option off may improve game speed.


=== Birth options ===

***** <birth_rand_artifacts>
Randomize all of the artifacts    [birth_rand_artifacts]
     A different set of artifacts will be created, in place of the standard 
     ones. This is intended primarily for people who have played enough to
     know what most of the standard artifacts do and have got bored with
     them. Without this option set, the standard artifacts will be used,
     along with a selection of random artifacts.

***** <birth_campaign>
Birth: Play in Lord of the Rings campaign    [birth_campaign]
     The character will start in Hobbiton, instead of Angband, and be able
     to travel to Rivendell, the Lonely Mountain, Isengard and other
     locations featured in the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings books.
     Be prepared for out of depth uniques (Especially at night), dungeon
     guardians you have to defeat in order to progress further, quest
     rewards in set locations, and dangerous battlefields and towers.

=== Cheating options ===

***** <cheat_auto>
Cheat: Auto-inscribe items as if known    [cheat_auto]
    Cheaters never win. But they squeltch lots.


=== Variant options ===

***** <variant_mushrooms>
Magic mushroom patch    [variant_mushrooms]
    Fun with mushrooms, and a reason to use a wand of Clone Monster on Magic
    Mushroom Patches... as if you need one ;)

***** <variant_free_stats>
Stat gain with each new level    [variant_free_stats]
    Increases a random stat (Strength, Intelligence, etc) every time the
    character gains a level.

***** <variant_fast_kills>
Kills don't waste blows    [variant_fast_kills]
    If a monster is killed with less blows than a character is capable of,
    the character may act immediately, instead of using a full turn and
    wasting the excess energy.

***** <variant_scale_dam>
Scale down melee damage    [variant_scale_dam]
    Scale down melee damage inflicted by the player, so that monster armor
    provides the same effective protection against the player's blows as
    the player's armor does against the monster's attacks. This option is
    used in conjunction with variant_scale_hp to make player spells more
    damaging against monsters, while leaving melee attacks and missile
    attacks no less effective.

***** <variant_scale_hp>
Scale down monster hit points    [variant_scale_hp]
    Scale down monster hit points by the same factor as melee damage is
    scaled down against them. This option only takes effect if the
    variant_scale_dam option is also in effect.

***** <variant_hit_traps>
Monsters hit traps    [variant_hit_traps]
    Monsters are affected by traps on the ground. The character does not
    receive any experience for monsters killed this way however.

***** <variant_oos_summons>
Monsters summon out of sight    [variant_oos_summons]
    Monsters can cast summoning spells while out of direct line of sight
    of the player. The summoned monsters appear around the summoner. It
    is strongly recommended that that the variant_unsummon option
    is used if this is selected.

***** <variant_oos_escapes>
Monsters teleport out of sight    [variant_oos_escapes]
    Monsters can teleport and blink while out of sight of the player.

***** <variant_oos_heals>
Monsters heal out of sight    [variant_oos_heals]
    Monsters can heal themselves while out of sight of the player.

***** <variant_oos_xtra>
Monsters aggravate out of sight    [variant_oos_xtra]
    Monsters can shriek and haste themselves while out of sight of the
    player.

***** <variant_dis_attacks>
Monsters use ranged attacks    [variant_dis_attacks]
    Monsters will use certain melee attacks at range.

***** <variant_hurt_feats>
Spells can destroy features    [variant_hurt_feats]
    Fire attacks destroy wooden features and so on, provided they are
    'sufficiently' damaging.

***** <variant_new_feats>
Generate trapped doors
    Generates new features in the dungeon, including trapped doors and
    chests. It is highly recommended that this option is switched on,
    as the game has not been thoroughly tested without it.

***** <variant_lake_feats>
Generate lakes and rivers
    Generate lakes and rivers of terrain through the dungeon. There
    will always be a 'shallow' path or bridge through the rivers and
    lakes created.

***** <variant_big_feats>
Generate big lakes and rivers
    Generate 'big' lakes and rivers through the dungeon, which are more
    likely to have disconnected areas. All rooms will be accessible
    however.

***** <variant_great_id>
Object sensing improved
    Classes with 'heavy' pseudo-id, and detect magic and detect curse
    spells and objects will be able to differentiate more power levels.
    {Very good} and {great} objects are {good} objects but with higher
    bonuses to hit, damage or armour class. {Superb} objects are Ego
    Items with hidden powers.

***** <variant_many_rings>
Wield multiple rings
    Up to 5 rings may be worn on each hand provided that they stack. No
    additional benefit is gained from wearing multiple rings, except
    economising on inventory space.

***** <variant_fast_floor>
Use objects faster from floor
    Any item may be used from the floor with only half the energy that
    it takes compared to items in the inventory. This includes using
    objects, firing and throwing objects, and spells from books on the
    floor.

***** <variant_fast_equip>
Use objects faster when wielded
    Any item may be wielded into the first equipment slot and used from
    that slot for half the energy it would require as compared to using
    the item from the inventory. Melee attacks still occur at the same
    speed however. A character wielding an item other than a weapon may
    only kick to attack while they do so. In addition, artifacts and
    other worn items only take half the energy to activate.

=== Save-file options ===

***** <variant_learn_id>
Object memory
    Remember what powers are known about objects, other than when an
    object is fully identified, and attempt to figure out what objects
    have particular powers by noticing when the character is not affected
    by various types of attacks.  In addition, ego items and artifacts
    will be remembered from game to game using the same save file. This
    option modifies the save file, to a format incompatible with vanilla
    Angband.

***** <variant_guess_id>
Object types guessed
    Attempt to guess, based on the powers known about an object, and what
    is known about object kinds, ego items and artifacts, what an object
    is.  This option modifies the save file, to a format incompatible
    with vanilla Angband.

***** <variant_usage_id>
Object usage count
    Keep track of the number of times an object is used, and after a
    number of uses, impart useful information about that object. This
    option modifies the save file, to a format incomaptible with vanilla
    Angband.

***** <variant_pval_stacks>
Object pval stacking (wands/staffs)
    Allow stacking of wands/staffs and other items that differ by pval.
    Without force_stack_pval, items will stack if they have the same sign
    and differ in pval by 1. eg a ring of Strength (+3) will stack with
    a ring of Strength (+2) or (+4) but not both. The most useful impact
    is that an identified stack of wands or staffs will not unstack until
    one of the items in the stack is depleted to zero charges.  This
    option modifies the save file, to a format incompatible with vanilla
    Angband.
   
***** <variant_time_stacks>
Object timeout stacking (rods)
    Allow stacking of rods and other items that differ by timeout. With-
    out force_stack_times, 1 charging item will stack with a stack of
    charged items, but further charging items will not stack in the stack.
    This option modifies the save file, to a format incompatible with
    vanilla Angband.

***** <variant_room_info>
Generate themed rooms
    Generate rooms that are filled with objects, monsters and terrain
    based on the room descriptions. This results in additional monsters
    and objects in the dungeon. This option modifies the save file, to a
    format incompatible with vanilla Angband.

***** <variant_belt_slot>
Add belt slot to equipment
    Adds an additional inventory slot to the equipment screen. Items are
    wielded into this slot from the equipment, instead of inventory. Items
    in this slot do not apply their powers to the wielder, but act as
    equipment for the purposes of the variant_fast_equipment option.  This
    option modifies the save file, to a format incompatible with vanilla
    Angband.

***** <variant_fast_moves>
Move faster but get tired
    Moving only takes half the energy, but instead the character quickly
    tires and has to recover by resting, or standing still, or risks
    fainting from exhaustion.  This applies to all activity, not just
    moving.  Selecting this option allows allows the character to tire
    out and drown realistically while swimming.  This option modifies
    the save file, to a format incompatible with vanilla Angband.

***** <variant_unsummon>
Limit power of summoning
    Monsters are limited to summoning every 50 turns, and monsters that
    they summon cannot summon themselves for 100 turns.  This option is
    also used to save additional information about monster state in the
    save file.  This option modifies the save file, to a format
    incompatible with vanilla Angband.

***** <variant_more_spells>
Learn more than 64 spells
    The character is not limited to 64 spells: instead their spell stat
    gives the only upper limit as to how many spells they may learn.  This
    option modifies the save file, to a format incompatible with vanilla
    Angband.

***** <variant_drop_body>
Monsters drop corpses
    Monsters drop corpses 30% of the time, and occasionally body parts and
    heads. This also allows the generation of monster body parts on the
    floor, as opposed to mummified corpses and broken teeth. This option
    modifies the save file, to a format incompatible with vanilla Angband.

***** <variant_save_feats>
    Features other than the first 255 are saved in the save file. In
    particular, this affects out door terrain.  This is a recommended
    option, especially with the variant_campaign. This option modifies the
    save file, to a format incompatible with vanilla Angband.
