# The following is derived from NPPAngband and Sangband.
#
# There are several implementation differences between here and NPPAngband.
#
# Traps in Unangband are all implemented as features. However, the effects
# code herein is used to configure a projection function that is tested every
# turn to see if a trap that is the source of the projection should be fired.
#
# e.g. ^xxxxxx checks the areas marked x from the trap ^. If the player enters
# this region and fails the trap test (see below)
#
#  discoloured sport - cool down after activation; thrown objects activate this
#  gas trap - effect is delayed a turn
#  loose rock - searching avoids
#  deadfall - takes several turns to hit targets; charging on the first turn avoids
#  siege engine - fired by an adjacent creature; doesn't activate otherwise
#  clockwork mechanism - fires regularly; cool down after activation
#
#  We want to try to do the following:
#
#  Sangband style seeker vortices, moving walls,
#
#  NPPAngband waves, glaciers.
#
#  Spell effects that bombard to/from a particular location, round by round.
#  Spell effects that try to pick a distant target and then affect it...
#  e.g. chain lightning.

# TRIGGER_MOVE: Trigger attack when moving into region
# LINGER: Trigger one grid when moving into region
# SPAWN: Instead of apply an attack, spawn a new region
# AUTOMATIC: Automatically apply effect every update
# MANUAL: Region effect only applied to 'newly affected' regions
# WALL: Advancing 'wall' of effect
# SEEKER: Seeker effect which hunts down targets
# PROJECTION: Grids affected are defined and updated as a projection
# SCALAR_FEATURE: Region scalar encodes a feature
# SCALAR_DAMAGE: Region scalar encodes damage
# SCALAR_VECTOR: Region scalar encodes direction and speed
# SCALAR_DISTANCE: Region scalar encodes distance
# CLOSEST_MON: Use closest monster as a target
# PLATFORM: As region moves, it pushes stuff around
# HIT_TRAP: Avoid triggering source as if a trap (requires trigger)
# RANDOM: Target a random grid in the region
# AGE_INCREASE: Damage increases with age. If DECREASE defined, damage peaks at 1/2 lifespan, then drops.
# AGE_DECREASE: Damage decreases with age. If INCREASE defined, damage peaks at 1/2 lifespan, then drops.
# INVERSE: Invert source and target when attacking
# NOTICE: Noticed region?
# CHAIN: Set region source and destination to source and target determined when attacking

# Version stamp (required)
