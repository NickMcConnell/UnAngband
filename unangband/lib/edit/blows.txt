# File: blows.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/blows.raw" file, which
# is used to initialize the "blows" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/spell.raw" file.

# Note that all monster blows and projection effects are specified
# in this file.

# The monster.txt spell.txt, terrain.txt, rune.txt and other files
# depend on this file to provide the blow names, in order that they
# can be parsed.

# We alias hit to 50% hit cut, 50% hit stun and handle bolt with a 10%
# chance of beam in the actual blow setup (hit_cut:50:hit_stun and
# bolt:10:beam respectively). Because 99% of blows are always identical
# (except hits), we alias all other blows to mean blow:0:miss

# Remember all hurt huge attacks are MON_BEAM | RAD_2 so all melee
# attacks need to be set up with this as the default.
