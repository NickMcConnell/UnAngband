# File: dungeon.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/dungeon.raw" file, which
# is used to initialize the "artifact" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/dungeon.raw" file.

# Note this file is used to hackily allow multiple towns, quest rewards and
# general derring do.

# Note we get quite sophisticated here, for very little cost but much hackery.

# === Understanding dungeon.txt ===

# Format:
# N: dungeon number: dungeon name
# X: easily connected to these dungeons (up to 4 - unused connections should point back to itself)
# L: level : fill with terrain (0=town) : big terrain : small terrain : quest monster : vault
# Q: dungeon connected to once quest monster defeated : quest monster
# Y: lock all shops until this monster is defeated : if player has visited this dungeon
# Z: substitute this dungeon instead : if player has visited this dungeon
# W: substitute this guardian monster instead: if player has visited this dungeon
# G: generate monsters with this character
# R: generate monsters with this flag
# S: store1 : store2 : store3 : store4 : store5 : store6 : store7 : store8
# D: description
# F: flags

# Note store 1 - 8 are now the index of the feature in terrain.txt not the store in store.txt.
# The 'power' of the feature determines which store to reference. So you can theoretically
# put any feature here you want.

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'X' indicates the dungeons that may be reached from this dungeon. The 'distant' dungeon
# can only be reached when the quest monster at the bottom of the dungeon is killed.

# 'L' defines dungeon 'zones'. A dungeon zone extends from the level listed until 1 below
# the next level listed. Zones must be shown in increasing order of level. The last L:
# entry defines the maximum depth of the dungeon. The first L: entry defines the 'surface level'
# of the dungeon and apparent depth is determined as offsets from this surface level.

# The quest monster must be a unique. The vault indicates an entry in the vault.txt file
# and places the vault in the centre of the level, but without any monsters, traps or treasure.

# 'G' indicates that all 'wandering' monsters on the level will be this char.

# 'R' indicates that all 'wandering' monsters on the level will have this flag. Acts as an
# either/or with the 'G' entry.

# 'S' indicates up to 8 stores from the store.txt file, that are placed on the level with
# the fill with terrain 0 tag.

# 'D' indicates the description displayed on the surface of the dungeon.

#Version information

V:0.6.2

# The non-existent dungeon. This used to be Angband, so we keep it here for compatibility.
# The non-campaign start is instead the second to last dungeon.
