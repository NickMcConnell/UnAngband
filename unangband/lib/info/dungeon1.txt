=== Travelling through the Wilderness ===

Once you are satisfied with your purchases, you can travel through the
wilderness to a nearby dungeon in search of adventure.  Use the travel
command ('<') when you are on the surface to be able to select a
nearby locale to travel to.

You'll see dungeon entrances marked as '>'.  To enter a dungeon, stand
on the entrance and use the climb down command ('>').  You can climb
back up using the climb up command ('<') if you find a set of stairs up
within the dungeon.  To save time, when you arrive at a town that has
a dungeon in it, you'll start on the entrance.  In the wilderness though,
you'll have to explore a little to find the dungeon entrance.
