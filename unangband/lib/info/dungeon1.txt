=== Your Home Town ===

Once you are satisfied with your purchases, you should visit 'Bag End' to
make this town your home.  Stores will only restock in your home town, so
which ever town you want to shop in, you should visit the home location
(shown by the '8' symbol) to reside there.  You'll also discover that the
contents of your home will move with you, so that you can keep useful
items in your home and be sure that they'll be available for you from
place to place.  You may find other non-shop locations in various towns
that you can store items in - be assured that these will be there for you
upon your return.

=== Travelling through the Wilderness ===

You can also travel through the wilderness to a nearby dungeon in search
of adventure.  Use the travel command ('<') when you are on the surface
to be able to select a nearby locale to travel to.

You'll see dungeon entrances marked as '>'.  To enter a dungeon, stand
on the entrance and use the climb down command ('>').  You can climb
back up using the climb up command ('<') if you find a set of stairs up
within the dungeon.  To save time, when you arrive at a town that has
a dungeon in it, you'll start on the entrance.  In the wilderness though,
you'll have to explore a little to find the dungeon entrance.
