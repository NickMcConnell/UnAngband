=== Words written in the after image of a burning fire ===

A thaumaturge is weaker than other users of magic for miscellaneous
purposes, but has powerful and unusual attack magics to compensate
for these weaknesses. Be initially wary of monsters immune to fire
as many of your spells will be useless against them, as well as
regions of water which reduce the strength of your fire and acid
magics when used against those sheltering in them.

- Find Flame will locate burning monsters and terrain, but also
scatters flames around you which can set alight nearby terrain and burn
your enemies, and briefly light up darkness.

- Wizard Lock will allow you to magically lock doors so that they are
much harder to open. This can help you escape monsters, even slowing
those which can open or bash doors, if there is a door between you and
them.

- Torch is your main magical attack: it does high damage but with a
limited range and will be ineffective against monsters which are
immune to fire damage. You can also use Torch to start fires, or burn
through some locked doors.

- Fire Walk will let you travel between places filled with fire and
smoke. If you are not standing in such a region, attempting to cast
this spell will not cost you time or mana. A lit torch - carried by
you or a monster - counts as a fiery location for this spell.

- Ignore Pain isn't as effective as healing potions but should
keep you alive long enough to survive most minor cuts and poisons.

- Fire Blast is a short range, damaging area effect attack.

- Acid Splash damages all adjacent monsters. You should be careful not
to use it when next to items which could be damaged by its effect.

- Infravision allows you to temporarily see warm blooded monsters who
might otherwise not be visible to you.

- Thaumaturgic Missile is the first of your more powerful attack
magics.

It takes fire to know fire, my friend.
