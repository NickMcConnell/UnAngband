=== An Addendum to the Overview of Potions ===

You could also experiment with throwing potions using the throw
command ('t' or 'v' in the roguelike commands) or by applying
them to weapons using the apply command ('y' or '^G' in the
roguelike command set).  These uses of potions are probably best
reserved for any harmful potions that you may find.
