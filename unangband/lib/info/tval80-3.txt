=== An Authoratative Guide to Mushrooms ===

Mushrooms come in a variety of colours and flavours, which can
change with every season. You can learn this information in
several ways, in particular, by buying or selling the mushrooms
to or from the well-stocked and open all hours of the day and early
evenings Farmer Maggot's Mushroom Emporium or (not recommended)
by eating the mushroom and noticing its effects.

A forthcoming illustrated guide in colour will also be available
from my publishing agents in due course.
