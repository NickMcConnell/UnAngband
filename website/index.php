      <h2>Welcome</h2>

      <p>Welcome to Unangband, my variant of Angband. Angband has a
long history of development: I recommend you check out the excellent
resources at <a href="http://angband.oook.cz/">angband.oook.cz</a> and the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_%28computer_game%29">wikipedia entry on Angband</a> if you are interested in
 the history and current state of the play for this game.</p>

      <p>I highly recommend you download the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=331">latest version</a>
of Unangband and start playing. Don't forget to upload your character
dumps to the Angband Ladder at angband.oook.cz and get bragging...</p>


	<p>If you are interested in the development side of Angband, check out the links under the resources section to the left,
	including my development blog, which is updated regularly. The only thing updated more frequently is the SVN source code
	repository, and you can browse that for tid bits on what will be in the next Unangband release. Of particular interest to
	you will be the change log and todo list that are maintained in the repository.</p>
